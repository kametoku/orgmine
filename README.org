#+title: orgmine mode - minor mode for org-mode with Redmine integration
#+author: Tokuya Kameshima

* About orgmine mode

~orgmine-mode~ is a minor mode for org-mode with Redmine integration.
In a =orgmine-mode= buffer, you can retrieve the issues from Redmine,
edit the entries of local, and submit the changes to Redmine.

* Getting started

** Requirements

=orgmine= depends on the following emacs lisp packages.
Install these packages as well.
- elmine
- s

=orgmine= was developed and tested on the following environment:
- GNU Emacs 24.3.1
- Org-mode 8.3.2

** Download and put orgmine.el to a directory in `load-path'.

The latest version of =orgmine.el= is available from:
https://github.com/kametoku/orgmine

** Edit your ~/.emacs

Add the following lines to your =~/.emacs= file so that the orgmine minor mode
is activated when the "om_project" property is defined as the file-wide
property.
Note that "om_project" property is a mandatory property to use orgmine.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (require 'orgmine)
  (add-hook 'org-mode-hook
            (lambda () (if (assoc "om_project" org-file-properties)
                           (orgmine-mode))))
#+end_src

*** =org-link-abbrev-alist= settings

If you prefer to visiting Redmine tickets by web browser via the org
links, add the link abbreviations to =org-link-abbrev-alist= as follows:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq org-link-abbrev-alist
        '(("redmine" . "http://redmine.example.com/")
          ;;...
	  ))
#+end_src

*** =orgmine-servers setting= settings

Setup =orgmine-servers= for your environments.
Prior to do this, please get the API key of the redmine REST API.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq orgmine-servers
        '(("redmine"                      ; server name for this entry
           (host . "http://redmine.example.com")
           (api-key . "blabblabblab")
           (issue-title-format . "[[redmine:issues/%{id}][#%{id}]] %{subject}")
           (journal-title-format . "[[redmine:issues/%{id}#note-%{count}][V#%{id}-%{count}]] %{created_on} %{author}")
           (version-title-format . "[[redmine:versions/%{id}][V#%{id}]] %{name}")
           (tracker-title-format . "%{name}")
           (project-title-format . "[[redmine:projects/%{identifier}][%{identifier}]] %{name}")
           (user-name-format . "%{firstname} %{lastname}"))))
#+end_src

** A .org file at a glance

The basic structure of org-mode file for orgmine minor mode is as follows:

You can run M-x orgmine-insert-template to retrieve basic settings for
orgmine mode.

*** #+SEQ_TODO settings

This is up to the statuses of the Redmine.

#+begin_src org
  ,#+SEQ_TODO: New(n) Open(o) Resolved(r) Feedback(f) | Closed(c)
#+end_src

*** #+TAGS settings

=orgmine= determines the headline types by its tags.

#+begin_src org
  ,#+TAGS: { UPDATE_ME(u) CREATE_ME(c) REFILE_ME(r) }
#+end_src

- UPDATE_ME: locally updated entry and need to be submitted to the redmine.
- CREATE_ME: a new entry to be submitted to the redmine.
- REFILE_ME: TBD

#+begin_src org
  ,#+TAGS: { om_project(p) om_tracker(t) om_version(v) om_issue(i) om_description(d) om_journals(J) om_journal(j) }
#+end_src

Also, the following tags specify the headline types.

| Tag            | Description                                             |
|----------------+---------------------------------------------------------|
| om_project     | project entry                                           |
| om_tracker     | tracker entry                                           |
| om_version     | fixed version entry                                     |
| om_issue       | issue entry                                             |
| om_description | description entry of an issue or project                |
| om_journals    | journals subtree entry that consists of journal entries |
| om_journal     | journal entry of an issue                               |
| om_attachment  | attachment entry of an issue                            |

You can change the tag names by =orgmine-tags= variable.
The following is an example of =orgmine-tags= setting.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq orgmine-tags '((update-me . "UPDATE_ME")
                       (create-me . "CREATE_ME")
                       (project . "project")
                       (tracker . "tracker")
                       (version . "version")
                       (issue . "issue")
                       (description . "description")
                       (journals . "journals")
                       (journal . "journal")
                       (attachments . "attachments")
                       (wiki . "wiki")))
#+end_src

*** #+PROPERTY settings 

This setting is a very important part of settings in the org-mode file.

#+begin_src org
  ,#+PROPERTY: om_server redmine
  ,#+PROPERTY: om_project 1:MyProject
  ,#+PROPERTY: om_assigned_to_ALL  1:Tokuya\ Kameshima 2:Pooh\ Winnie
  ,#+PROPERTY: om_done_ratio_ALL 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100
  ,#+PROPERTY: om_tracker_ALL 1:Defect 4:Task 8:Milestone
  ,#+PROPERTY: om_me 1:Tokuya\ Kameshima
  ,#+PROPERTY: om_cf_12_resolution_ALL fixed declined deferred obsolete documentation
#+end_src

| Property           | Must | Description                                     |
|--------------------+------+-------------------------------------------------|
| om_server          | Must | redmine server name                             |
| om_project         | Want | default project ID followed by ":" and its name |
| om_assigned_to_ALL | Wish | users of the project                            |
| om_done_ratio_ALL  | Wish | done_ratio values 0 to 100 stepped by 10        |
| om_tracker_ALL     | Wish | tracker IDs with their names                    |
| om_me              | Wish | my user ID followed by ":" and its name         | 

The property =om_server= determines which server setting in
=orgmine-server-list= should be used.

*** #+COLUMNS settings (optional) 

#+begin_src org
  ,#+COLUMNS: %50ITEM(Task) %9om_assigned_to(Assigned) %8om_tracker(Tracker) %5Effort(Est.){:} %CLOCKSUM(Clock) %SCHEDULED %DEADLINE %TAGS
#+end_src

*** Insert an existing issue as an org mode entry

Run M-x orgmine-insert-issue (or press C-c m I) and enter an issue id
to insert the issue entry.

This operation is not usual but just for demonstration.
As usual, the issue entries are placed
under project, version or tracker subtree and maintained there.

The following is an example of issue entry.
Notice that the issue attributes are inserted as properties of the entry,
the issue description, attachments, journals (comments) are inserted
as child entry of the issue entry.
They are located by the tags (:issue:, :description:, :attachments: :journals:,
and :journal: in this example).

Note that the start date and due date attributes of the Redmine issue
are converted to SCHEDULE and DEADLINE properties of org-mode entry,
and the status attribute of the Redmine issue is converted to the
TODO keywords of org-mode entry.

#+begin_src org
  ,* New [[redmine:issues/24]] Implement orgmine-xxx function :issue:

*** Update the issue

Now, we are going to edit the issue entry and send the changes to Redmine.

**** Edit the issue entry locally

You can edit the issue entry in orgmine buffer to update the issue.
The following updates are supported.

- Change the issue attributes.
  --- =orgmine-set-entry-property= (C-c m ; ;)
- Change the issue status.
  --- =org-todo= (C-c C-t)
- Change the start date.
  --- =org-schedule= (C-c C-s)
- Change the due date.
  --- =org-deadline= (C-c C-d)
- Change or add the description.
  --- =orgmine-add-description= (C-c m d)
- Add a journal note.
  --- =orgmine-add-journal= (C-c m j)
- Add attachments to the issue.
  --- =orgmine-add-attachment= (C-c m a)

If you edit description note by hand, you need add :UPDATE_ME: tag to
the description headline.
:UPDATE_ME: is a special tag for orgmine-mode to locate the portion of
local changes when submitting the change to Redmine.

#+begin_src org
  ,** Description			       :UPDATE_ME:description:
     ,#+begin_src gfm
       This is a hard part.  <-- Not really...
     ,#+end_src
#+end_src

**** Send the changes to Redmine

To submit the changes to Redmine, move the cursor to the issue headline
and run M-x orgmine-submit (C-c m c).

If there are no problems, the changes are sent to Redmine and the local
issue entry is updated by new contents and attributes.

**** Investigate differences between local entry and Redmine

If someone else has updated the issue while you are editing the issue entry,
you will get the following error when submitting the changes.

#+begin_example
  #24: entry has been updated by other user.
#+end_example

In this case, you can run M-x orgmine-ediff (C-c m ?) to run ediff on
the Redmine's latest issue contents and your local entry.
And you can investigate the differences of them and merge the update
to your entry.

*** Fetch the update of the issue

Move the cursor to the issue headline and run M-x orgmine-fetch (C-c m f)
to fetch the latest contents of the issue from Redmine and update the
local entry.

*** Add a new issue

You can run M-x orgmine-add-issue (C-c m i) to add a new issue entry.

#+begin_src org
  ,* New 					:issue:CREATE_ME:
    :PROPERTIES:
    :om_start_date: [2015-10-16 Fri]
    :END:
#+end_src

After editing the entry (e.g., adding title, description, attributes
and due date), run M-x orgmine-submit (C-c m c) to submit the new
issue to Redmine.  The contents are sent to Redmine and the local entry
is updated with the issue created.

The following is an example of issue entry just after creation.

#+begin_src org
  ,* New [[redmine:issues/25][#25]] write document about orgmine  :issue:
    DEADLINE: <2015-10-23 Fri> SCHEDULED: <2015-10-16 Fri>
    :PROPERTIES:
    :om_id:    25
    :om_tracker: 4:Task
    :om_created_on: 2015-10-16T07:58:51Z
    :om_updated_on: 2015-10-16T07:58:51Z
    :om_status: 1:New
    :om_fixed_version: 5:Documentation
    :om_start_date: [2015-10-16 Fri]
    :om_due_date: [2015-10-23 Fri]
    :om_done_ratio: 0
    :om_project: 1:SandBox
    :END:
#+end_src

The following table summarizes the org mode properties and redmine attributes
for an issue entry.

| Org-mode Property | Redmine Attribute      | Comment                        |
|-------------------+------------------------+--------------------------------|
| om_id             | issue id               |                                |
| om_tracker        | tracker                | id + ":" + tracker name        |
| om_created_on     | creation date&time     | w/timezone format              |
| om_updated_on     | last updated date&time | w/timezone format              |
| om_status         | issue status           | converted to TODO keywords     |
| om_fixed_version  | fixed version          | id + ":" + version name        |
| om_start_date     | issue start date       | converted to SCHEDULE property |
| om_due_date       | issue due date         | converted to DEADLINE property |
| om_done_ratio     | issue done ratio       |                                |
| om_project        | issue's project        | id + ":" + project name        |

Note that if both of a property and the corresponding special keyword
exist for a single issue entry, the special keyword is preferred.

*** Project subtree

Now, you are ready to retrieve the entries from the redmine.
In the orgmine buffer run M-x orgmine-insert-project (or press C-c m P),
and you will be prompted to specify the project id to insert.
Enter the project id and press enter key, and then =orgmine= retrieves
the project properties and insert the project entry with the headline.

The following is an example of the result.
Notice the project properties are inserted as the entry's properties
and the project description is inserted as a sub entry and quoted in src block.

#+begin_src org
  ,* SandBox ([[redmine:projects/sandbox]])                         :project:
    :PROPERTIES:
    :om_project: 1:SandBox
    :om_created_on: 2015-07-31T06:40:56Z
    :om_updated_on: 2015-08-18T05:42:26Z
    :om_status: 1
    :om_identifier: sandbox
    :END:
  ,** Description                                                   :description:
     ,#+begin_src gfm
       This is a sandbox project. Feel free to play with this project.
     ,#+end_src
#+end_src

**** Retrieving issues

Move the cursor on the line of project headline and run
M-x =orgmine-sync-subtree-recursively= (=C-c m s=) to retrieve all the issues
of the project.
The issue entries are inserted as the child entries of the project entry.

*** Version subtree

You can maintain the issue entries of a certain version in a subtree.

The following is an example of Version subtree

#+begin_src org
  ,* [[redmine:versions/3]] Sprint-001				:version:
    DEADLINE: <2015-09-04 Fri>
    :PROPERTIES:
    :om_fixed_version: 3:Sprint-001
    :om_created_on: 2015-08-02T14:18:41Z
    :om_updated_on: 2015-08-04T16:12:22Z
    :om_status: open
    :om_due_date: [2015-09-04 Fri]
    :om_project: 1:SandBox
    :END:
#+end_src

*** Tracker subtree

As well as versions, you can put the issues of a certain tracker
in a subtree.

The following piece of org-mode file demonstrates a tracker subtree.
You can put the issue entries of Milestone tracker in the "* Milestone" tree.

#+begin_src org
  ,* Milestone                                                    :tracker:
    :PROPERTIES:
    :om_tracker: 8:Milestone
    :END:
  ,** [[redmine:issue/1]] New Code Freeze                         :issue:
     DEADLINE: <2015-09-30 Wed> SCHEDULED: <2015-09-30 Wed>
     :PROPERTIES:
     :om_id: 123
     :om_tracker: 8:Milestone
     :om_created_on: 2015-09-04T00:56:07Z
     :om_updated_on: 2015-10-01T08:57:24Z
     :om_status: 1:New
     :om_start_date: [2015-09-30 Wed]
     :om_due_date: [2015-09-30 Wed]
     :om_done_ratio: 0
     :om_project: 84:VIS14.0SP1
     :END:
#+end_src

*** Sync the buffer with Redmine

So far, we used M-x orgmine-sync-subtree-recursively (C-c m s) to
synchronize the entries with Redmine.
You can use M-x orgmine-sync-buffer (C-c m S) to synchronize
entries of whole the buffer with Redmine.

* The open issues

1. Not enough error handling.
   =orgmine= uses =elmine.el= to communicate with Redmine but =elmine.el=
   does not raise the errors even when Redmine returns some error code.

* Customization

You can customize =orgmine= with M-x customize.
See the docstring of each customizable variables of =orgmine=.
